# 🎯 Multimodal Emotion Recognition using TESS Dataset

This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from speech and text
using deep learning and multimodal fusion techniques.



## 📌 Project Overview

Emotion recognition plays a vital role in human-computer interaction.
This project compares:

- Speech-only model
- Text-only model
- Multimodal Fusion model

to analyze performance improvements using multimodal learning.



## 📊 Dataset

**Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)**

- Contains emotional speech samples
- Emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Pleasant Surprise
- Recorded by professional actresses

### 🔹 Speech Model
- Feature: MFCC
- Architecture: BiLSTM + Dense
- Input: Audio (.wav)

### 🔹 Text Model
- Feature: Synthetic Text Metadata
- Architecture: Embedding + BiLSTM
- Input: Generated Text

### 🔹 Fusion Model
- Feature: Speech + Text
- Architecture: Late Fusion Neural Network
